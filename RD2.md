I was able to learn how to write
an algorithm and code for a 
virtual atm that could deposit, withdraw or 
display money. We used a while loop
so that the user could keep inputting 
different values so that the balance in the account
would reflect their previous changes.
First we made an algorithm and test cases
to make sure that the program would work,
then we made a workable program.
Our results do match what we expected to get, and it
has error cases that accurately reflect
each possible error. The biggest challenge to me
was the fact that there were many possible errors
and to make sure we had every one was tedious.
We first designed, thought and planned,
then worked on the program and then tested with
various values. It was nice working with Eric, things
went smoothly.
